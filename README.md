# Design-Patterns
This repo includes reusable design pattern examples presented in the book, *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*.
## Catalog of Design Patterns
* __Abstract Factory__: <br> Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* __Adapter__: <br> Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
* __Bridge__: <br> Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
* __Builder__: <br> Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
* __Chain of Responsibility__: <br> Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
* __Command__: <br> Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
* __Composite__: <br> Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
* __Decorator__: <br> 
* __Facade__: <br> 
* __Factory Method__: <br> 
* __Flyweight__: <br> 
* __Interpreter__: <br> 
* __Iterator__: <br> 
* __Mediator__: <br> 
* __Memento__: <br> 
* __Observer__: <br> 
* __Prototype__: <br> 
* __Proxy__: <br> 
* __Singleton__: <br> 
* __State__: <br> 
* __Strategy__: <br> 
* __Template Method__: <br> 
* __Visitor__: <br> ß
