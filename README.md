# Design-Patterns
This repo includes reusable design pattern examples presented in the book, *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*.
## Catalog of Design Patterns
* __Abstract Factory__: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* __Adapter__: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
* __Bridge__: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
* __Builder__: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
* __Chain of Responsibility__: Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
* __Command__: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
* __Composite__: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
* __Decorator__:
* __Facade__:
* __Factory Method__:
* __Flyweight__:
* __Interpreter__:
* __Iterator__:
* __Mediator__:
* __Memento__:
* __Observer__:
* __Prototype__:
* __Proxy__:
* __Singleton__:
* __State__:
* __Strategy__:
* __Template Method__:
* __Visitor__:
